/**
 * Class to translate a JSQLParser statement into a relational algebra query
 * plan. For now only
 * works for Statements that are Selects, and specifically PlainSelects. Could
 * implement the visitor
 * pattern on the statement, but doesn't for simplicity as we do not handle
 * nesting or other complex
 * query features.
 *
 * <p>
 * Query plan fixes join order to the order found in the from clause and uses a
 * left deep tree
 * join. Maximally pushes selections on individual relations and evaluates join
 * conditions as early
 * as possible in the join tree. Projections (if any) are not pushed and
 * evaluated in a single
 * projection operator after the last join. Finally, sorting and duplicate
 * elimination are added if
 * needed.
 *
 * <p>
 * For the subset of SQL which is supported as well as assumptions on semantics,
 * see the Project
 * 2 student instructions, Section 2.1
